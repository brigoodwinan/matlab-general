addpath matlab/HMM/Demos

The following demonstration files are included.
They do not produce any interesting output; they merely check
the code runs without crashing. Please read the source code for
details.

- learn_dhmm_demo illustrates how to learn an HMM with discrete observations
- learn_mhmm_demo illustrates how to learn an HMM with a mixture of Gaussians observations
- fixed_lag_demo  illustrates how to do fixed lag smoothing
- online_em_demo  illustrates how to combine fixed-lag smoothing and EM
