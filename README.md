matlab functions for general use.

I am a biomedical engineer and I use matlab extensively - so I have a collection of functions that I have made over the past 8ish years. 

Many of the functions may require matlab toolboxes like Iso2Mesh and NIFTI. The help display for each function should indicate the required toolboxes for a certain function to run.
