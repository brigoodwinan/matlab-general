% This utilizes the "dost" function with the purpose of conserving memory.
%
% INPUTS:
% sig: n-by-1 signal
% t: n-by-1 time stamps
% windowSize: (optional) size of window (integer) (default: 5000)
% windowOverlap: (optional) window overlap when computing the stran
%      (default: 0.5)
%
% OUTPUTS:
% dc: discrete orthonormal time-frequency data for the signal.
% new_sig: the new signal after truncation to line up with sxfm.
% new_t: the new time stamps after truncation.
